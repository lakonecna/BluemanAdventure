BluemanAdventure - straight laced but unwilling hero on a quest
to find his father, the captured king of the four realms of
fire, earth, water and air.

Blueman travels through 4 levels, one for each of the planets,
Vodin, Ohenus, Zemere and Ventis, in the Universum of the 4 brothers, the
realm of Big 4. Each inspired by water, fire, earth and air.
He starts his story in water ( but only passingly), as this is
the home he has decided to leave. Now living a life
of pleasure and hedonism in the capital of the realm,
he finds out his father has been kingnapped.
He decides to go on the quest to find him, (Why?).
First he travels through air (current position), then earth, then fire, before 
returning to water. In each he battles different enemies,
finds different friends.
Through air he travels because that is where the capital is.
Through earth he travels to get to water.
On the way he is attacked by fire.
