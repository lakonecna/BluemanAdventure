BluemanAdventure - straight laced but unwilling hero on a quest
to find his father, the captured king of the four realms of
fire, earth, water and air.

Game Overview:
	Game Concept:
		Blueman travels through 4 levels, one for each of the planets,
		Vodin, Ogen'us, Semere and Aentis. In each he sees specific colors, hears specific sounds.
		He meets friends and foes, friends give him health, foes take it away.
		He can kill both of them, but if he kills a friend, Blueman too will suffer.
		At the end of each level he obtains a scroll, a message from his father.
		He puts together the messages to build the map to his father.
		The last level is a bird's view labyrinth. There are four possible exit chambers, 
		the map leads the player to the correct one.
		The game ends when the player dies in the final level, or when they find the correct exit.

	Genre:
		Adventure Platformer with a story in the background.

	Target Audience:
		10 year old boys, Samuel, Alexander and Oskar. 

	Game flow summary:
		The player moves through the game using the keyboard interface.
		Up to jump, down to protect themselves, left/ right as expected.
		If they press left/right twice they will run.
		Hit with d, collect an item with c, open inventory with i.

		The player sees a moving background, less Donkey Kong, more Super MArio Bros style.
		NPCs come from right/ left. Player has a health bar and protection bar as part of their hud.
		
	Look and feel of the game:
		Pixelated, even exagerrated in this regard. There is no roundness in the game.
		The colours are simple, but they should fit together well stylistically,
		unlike in most retro looking games (with their charming but too strong colours).
		Each world should have its own set of colours.
		That said, the game should look very simple shapewise. 
		
Gameplay and Mechanics:
	Gameplay:
		Game progression:
			The player moves through the game by moving from the start point to the end point.
			This could be vertically (air and water) or horizonatally (earth and fire).
			They progress by collecting key items at the end of each level.
			They must also destroy their enemies (or they themselves will be killed).
			At the end they must exit the game using the correct protal,
			which they will only be able to tell apart using the key items they collected.
			Blueman should also be presented with memories which will give him clues on how best to 
			pass the level (to represent life lessons as well as add story).
			
		Mission Challenge Structure:
			At the beginning of each level they must be told WHY they are trying to reach the end.
			This could be done textually or through extremely simplistic cut scenes.
			Ex. Zemer: Zemer Capital Spina: bar to court. In the bar news reach him that his father has disappeared.
			He decides to drop his facade as Earth King's guard and talk to the Earth king.
			The way there is the game's tutorial. When he reaches the court however, he is targeted by the earth king
			and must make his escape of the city.
			
		Puzzle structure:
			There is no puzzles. The correct items must be in the players inventory for 100% success,
			but chance can always allow the player to win. Maybe a memory/ to life lesson system
			could be introduced. 
			Ex: player is showed Blueman's memory of his father's kings guard teaching him to use 
			the daggers. This could be done in the middle of a level which is likely/easiest to be completed
			using the daggers. It could also show the respect Blueman felt for the king's guard and the 
			lack of love he has for his father.

		Objectives:
			Heave Blueman learn from his past life. He cannot escape responsibility.
			Use these life lessons to pass the platformer levels, to collect the correct
			items. Build the map, escape the game, enter the real world, hopefully find your father.
			
		Game flow:
			The game should pass by relatively quickly, taking 1 hour - 3 hours to complete.
			The rate of enemy attack should be high. The music should be quick/ smooth/ progressive.
			Sometimes the rate of change between collection/ hits should be high.
			Items can be destroyed too with hits, even the crucial ones.
			
	Mechanics:
		Physics: How does the physical universe work?
			Depends on the world. 
			Magic exists but it is denied.
			Aentis: 
				very cloudy planet, the closer you get to the core, the darker it gets,
				the pressure slowly increases. Smallest of the planets with smallest gravity.
				Eventually the atmosphere is so thick it is almost liquid like.
				At a certain point, the temperature starts increasing. We are nearing the core.
				There are oceans of glowing liquid metallic hydrogen. It is so dense it isn't gaseaous anymore.
				It rolls and convects, just like magma. Generates strong magnetic field.
				Everything is glowing, red, yellow until white.
				There are two main environments here:
					- Frissure
						overcast, quick to move, cloudy, stormy. Everything flies. The gravity is small here.
						Intelligent life here comes from other aliens that immigrated ages ago.
						These are tall and lighte with technology eveloved towards flight.
						Floating cities which obtain energy from glowing hot helloy.
						When used up, this metal is released back into the atmosphere as cloud.
						A character falls here, but slowly. Its bright above and darker below.
						Plants are present but not natural to the environment and also evolved
						towards being long and tall.
					- The Lace/Webbing 
						very dark here, difficult to get through, nothing lives here.
						cold and desolate and is the area where pressure changes from
						low to high, from gas to liquid.
						This is the source lots of tubing which carries Helloy to the toppers.
						Toppers release underlings here.
					- Riche's Bay/ Vertex  
						ocean of red-white liquid hydrogen (Helloy). Pressure is extremely high, higher than
						all other planets. Everything is squat and long. It is brighter below and darker above.
						The hydrogen is convecting and the magnetism is strong.
						Creatures, or Hyado-mori, are not organic. They are snakelike robots covered in a metallic exosuit 
						designed to mine helloy by swallowing it, carrying it to the tubing, vomitting it out inside.
			Vodin:
				A planet of storming sea. Nothing is above sea level but boats.
				Some areas are too stormy to voyage.
				Player can swim up by jumping and swim down by crouching.
				The oldest inhabitants of the universe live here.
				Divided into:
					- Miaso:
						The intelligent, original inhabitants of the sea floor (think intelligent mermen), 
						built up into lighter areas. They are more resistant to the radiation from above,
						their skin is darker, their eyes are smaller with extra membranes.
						Their bones are thinner and they are much larger than the Meyehmevax.
						They have cities just like us. No sky scrapers, no walls, no floors,
						instead a basket like waeve is suspended on the helloy tubing from below.
						Everything but the tubing is built to be elastic and move with the flow of water.
						There is technology everywhere, it is all powered by helloy which was once
						mined in yahdiri but now comes from Riche's bay.
					- Yahdiri:
						It is an underwater rain forest. Many wild beast live here.
						There used to be cities, but these have been abandoned. There is much tubing around
						which used to carry helloy from the core of the planet before the discovery of Riche's Bay.
						There is tell of a cannibalistic tribe of Meyehmevax, predecessors to Miasovans.
						Really they are an abused people, their labour was used to mine what was left
						of Vodin's helloy before they were abandon by the rulers of Masovians.
						They are simple aboriginal people who live without electricity.
						They use a bioluminescent sea moss known as Occoboji as a sorce of light.
						They are farmers and hunters, smaller than Miasovians, larger eyes.
						Very pale because they are unused to sunlight. Their bones are stronger to handle the pressure.
						They are covered with exoskeleton scales, they have mermaid tails but above are antropomorphic.
						Beasts are like dinosaurs, bus-sized crabs and spiders. 
						Some Hyadomori wreckages may be found here.
						Plants are weedlike/ snakelike.
			Ogen'us:
				Largest planet.
				It is a sun. Convecting pockets of hot gas under the surface cause Granulation.
				Sometimes, these bubbles pop causing solar flares and even prominences.
				Are there any bad guys? Maybe the environment is the bad guy?
				Are there any Hyadomori? What's under the surface? Is it only the convection causing the bubbles?
				Or is there a sleeping dragon? Can this dragon be explained by science.
				There is a region above the range of prominences as well as the pull of gravity,
				where orbiting solar panels are circulating and collecting the energy. This is collected in batteries
				and sent in ships to other planets. There are many floating vessels about.
				Experiments and most energy science is going on here, close to an energy source.
			Semere:
				Very much like our world. 3rd largest planet. 
				Frissure was first colonized by Semerians.
				Semerians are bio-technologically advanced Miasovians. They are still biologically Miasovians,
				but they use bioscience to build technology which allows them to walk bipedally like weird 
				two legged forest dwellers of this planet.
				There are plants, many biotech races. Helloy is useful but difficult to comeby since it is far both high and low.
				Ogen'us is the prime source of energy.
				Gravity acts down. Water may be found and in it, colonies of Vodins.
				Frissure-folk di Aentis may visit, but in suits or regulated environments, the pressure is too high.
				Miasovians too but also in suits.
				
			Characters alien to the current world need suits to survive in the world.
		Movement in the game:
			Aentis: flying, left, right, up, down (fire/ jet powered suit)
			Vodin: swimming, left right up and down (biological movement)
			Ogen'us: walking left right, crouching down, jumping up (electric but bipedal suit)
			Semere: walking left right, crouching down, jumping up (electric but bipedal suit)
		Objects in game:
			there are five types of objects: healing, harming, armouring, unarmouring and special.
			These can change the state of:
				unary: 
					healing must be collected or pressed enter on in inventory
					self harming is not okay
					armouring must be pressed enter on in inventory to be worn
					unarmouring must be currently worn and pressed enter on in inventory
					special depends on object
				binary:
					healing will heal/ build the character/ object in focus of the user
					harming will harm character/object in focus of the user (armour then health)
					armouring will armour character in focus of the user
					unarmouring will unarmour the character in focus of the user
			pick object with c, in inventory enter is pressed to hold object or space to change to next one.
			drop held object with x
			use a held object on another with range with d (example sword would kill, shovel would dig).
		Actions:
			Input:
				keyboard is used to interact with the game.
				? - gives/ removes info on object held in inventory
				i - opens/ closes inventory interface (which covers the screen)
				x - to drop held object
				space - to change currently held object from the inventory (to next in queue)
				enter - to choose object to hold when in inventory
				d - to use held object on the object in the direction in player's focus
				c - to collect/ put something in inventory
				up/ down/ left/ right (click) - jump up and look up, crouch down and look down, move once and look in the direction
				up/ down/ left/ right (press and hold) - the same as click for u/d, 
													keep looking in the direction as well as move there for l/r
			Output: 
				the screen shows players position, the objects/ npcs around them.
				the hud in lower left corner shows current health and armouring rating of the player
		Combat: //TODO****************************************************************************************************
			all objects/ characters have a rate of health change and a rate of armour change 
			as well as a health rating and armouring rating, these are on a scale of -100 to 100, where
			-100 means death or 0 armouring and 100 means full health and full armouring
			Health isn't lost by external damage unless armouring is at -100.
			Rate of health loss is calculated based on current armouring.
			Rate of armour loss is constant.
			player takes away npc armour by focusing on them and using unarmouring/harming objects on them.
			The smaller the armouring rating, the quicker the rate of health loss
		//****************************************************************************************************************
		Economy:
			Players: They can collect batteries, helloy tubing and occoboji.
			These can then be used to buy XEB57 updates like pressure or flight for armouring 
			or aether droids for health repair.
			
			World: Helloy, batteries and occoboji are the main currencies of the world.

		Game Options:
			There is not much optionality.
			The player can only win or loose. They can choose
			not to collect objects but that will only make their winning odds smaller.
		Replaying and saving:
			A save is defined as player name, current level, hud state and inventory state. 
			The save when clicked will put the player at the very beginning of the level after
			the one they have passed. If there is a cut scene after their finished level, they will watch it again.
			At the end of the game, their save implies they completed the game.
			If the player wants to restart/ replay a game, they can do so from the GameMenu of their save.
		Cheats and Easter Eggs:
			There is no cheats and no easter eggs, except for those referring to the game's world and its history.
			Ex of easter eggs: Wreckages of hyadomori in the Yahdiri

	Levels
			
The Universum of the 4 brothers, the realm of Big 4
 Each inspired by water, fire, earth and air.
He starts his story in water ( but only passingly), as this is
the home he has decided to leave. Now living a life
of pleasure and hedonism in the capital of the realm,
he finds out his father has been kingnapped.
He decides to go on the quest to find him, (Why?).
First he travels through air (current position), then earth, then fire, before 
returning to water. In each he battles different enemies,
finds different friends.
Through air he travels because that is where the capital is.
Through earth he travels to get to water.
On the way he is attacked by fire.
