-ball is tightly coupled with the pingers, it knows a lot about them, it shouldn't
	Currently :
		Ball knows pinger is a rectangle that it is bouncing off of
		Should it? The point of the ball is to bounce off the walls and pingers
		maybe thats a coupling which makes sense
		Or should this functionality be delegated to another class which knows something about both pinger and ball?
- ball updates twice with every run of the game loop
- there is no game structure implemented yet
- the OverlapDecider2D only works for 2 rectangles, needs to be updated
- mabye OD2D should operate by deciding overlap based on area immediately, instead of doing the current calculation
- the division of the space around the pinger into rectangles isn't 100% precise, should it be updated?
